# CSAir
CS 242 Programming Studio Project

You are a senior software engineer for a new international airline, CSAir. Before CSAir launches passenger service across the globe, they first need to start selling tickets to passengers. But before that can happen, some software needs to be written to manage the extensive route map. You have been tasked by CEO Woodley to begin work on this software. Specifically, the initial requirements for this new software are:
Parse the raw data that represents CSAir's route map into a data structure in memory
Allow users of the software to query data about each of the destinations that CSAir flies to, including its code, name, country, continent, timezone, longitude and latitude, population, region, and each of the cities that are accessible via a single non-stop flight from that destination
Provide a graphical representation of CSAir's route map
